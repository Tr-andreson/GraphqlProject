### 8. **Search and Filtering**
   - **Search Bar**: Implement a search feature that allows users to search products by name, category, or keywords.
   - **Product Filtering**: Provide filters for price range, categories, ratings, and brands to refine product search results.

   - **Shipping Rates**: Integrate with third-party shipping providers to calculate real-time shipping costs.
