/**
 * Map of all GraphQL operations in the project.
 *
 * This map has several performance disadvantages:
 * 1. It is not tree-shakeable, so it will include all operations in the project.
 * 2. It is not minifiable, so the string of a GraphQL query will be multiple times inside the bundle.
 * 3. It does not support dead code elimination, so it will add unused operations.
 *
 * Therefore it is highly recommended to use the babel or swc plugin for production.
